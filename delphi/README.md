# Delphi

This directory contains generated interface for calling Leapfrog from Delphi via the DLL.

This is generated by leapfrog repo, but it is intended to be used by copying it into your Delphi project. It requires 2 external files to work
* The compiled leapfrog DLL, this should be compiled from the `c_interface` by running `./c_interface/build_dll.sh`
* A runtime fixed-length array type called GBFixedArray which should be in your project, it is included here for completeness sake
these should also be copied into your Delphi project.
