## Installation

To install `frogger`:

```r
remotes::install_github("mrc-ide/frogger", upgrade = FALSE)
```

## TODO

* Improve variable names!
* Restructuring the model code to identify more common code
    * There are examples like general demographic projection and hiv population demographic projection which are running
      similar processes like ageing, non HIV mortality, migration. We should be able to write a function for e.g. ageing
      which we can run on each of our population matrices. Even for the HIV and ART stratified we can add overloaded
      function to work with higher dimension data
* Add a test that checks that no `double`s are used in `inst/include` dir. We should be using templated `real_type` for
  TMB
* Add a broad level overview of the algorithm - is there a diagram available?
* Add a test which proves that C++ code can be compiled standalone, one exists in dust that can be used as inspriration
* Tidy data copying a tensor2 to matrix and a tensor n to array utility functions which should be used in C++ R
  interface "src/frogger.cpp"
* Ensure input data is not copied, we can read from the data that R owns (as long as don't write to it)
* Convert string flags to the model to enums if we need to switch on them in several places. This should make it easier
  to reason about in C++ world and isolate the string checking to a single place
* Update `gender` terminology to sex
* Previously `hiv_negative_pop` was fixed size by having dimensions specified by template, how much does this speed up
  the code? Is there a better way to do this?
* Tidy up confusing looping see https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217847753
* Add R casting helpers which return better errors than Rcpp
  see https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217884684
* Add a helper to do 0 to base 1 conversion and check upper bounds
  see https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217888684
* Review what we pass as parameters - can some of these be computed in the struct ctor?
  e.g. https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217890466
* Add function for calculating incidence rate per sex https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217848792
* Make fit work with coarse ages (at the moment not reading all of the coarse stratified data)
* Remove duplicate reading of `hAG_SPAN_full`, read this as `hiv_age_groups_span` and `age_groups_hiv_span`
