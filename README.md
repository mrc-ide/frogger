## Installation

To install `frogger`:

```r
remotes::install_github("mrc-ide/frogger", upgrade = FALSE)
```

## TODO

* Improve variable names!
* Restructuring the model code to identify more common code
    * There are examples like general demographic projection and hiv population demographic projection which are running
      similar processes like ageing, non HIV mortality, migration. We should be able to write a function for e.g. ageing
      which we can run on each of our population matrices. Even for the HIV and ART stratified we can add overloaded
      function to work with higher dimension data
* Add a test that checks that no `double`s are used in `inst/include` dir. We should be using templated `real_type` for
  TMB
* Add a broad level overview of the algorithm - is there a diagram available?
* Convert string flags to the model to enums if we need to switch on them in several places. This should make it easier
  to reason about in C++ world and isolate the string checking to a single place
* Update `gender` terminology to sex
* Previously `hiv_negative_pop` was fixed size by having dimensions specified by template, how much does this speed up
  the code? Is there a better way to do this?
* Tidy up confusing looping see https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217847753
* Add R casting helpers which return better errors than Rcpp
  see https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217884684
* Add a helper to do 0 to base 1 conversion and check upper bounds
  see https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217888684
* Review what we pass as parameters - can some of these be computed in the struct ctor?
  e.g. https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/7#discussion_r1217890466
* Refactor `OutputState` to take a struct of state-space dimensions instead of unpacking the subset of parameters we
  need. See https://github.com/mrc-ide/frogger/pull/12#discussion_r1245170775

## Leapfrog to Frogger glossary

Frogger naming rules

* `p_` prefix indicates this is age stratified by total single year i.e. same age stratification as total population
* `h_` prefix indicates this is age stratified by same age stratification as HIV adult population, this might be single
  year from
  15+ or could be coarse age groups
* `hc_` prefix indicates this is age stratified by the HIV child population
* `idx_` prefix means this is an index
* Uppercase means this is a dimension of the state space e.g. `NS` or `pAG`
* `ts_` prefix means this is a time step
* `hts_` prefix means this is an HIV time step (i.e. a time step of the inner HIV loop)

These prefixes can be merged e.g.

* `p_idx_hiv_first_adult` - Is the index of the first age group within singe-year ages to be considered an adult

### State space

In `StateSpace` struct
