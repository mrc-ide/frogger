Description: Frogger is a multistate population projection model for estimating population, demographic indicators, and HIV epidemic. The model combines a standard cohort component model of population projection (CCMPP) with a multistate model for HIV infection, disease progression, and treatment. Statistical tools are implemented for joint inference from multiple demographic and epidemiologic data sources.
