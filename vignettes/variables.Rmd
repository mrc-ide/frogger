# Frogger naming rules

* `p_` prefix indicates this is age stratified by total single year i.e. same age stratification as total population
* `h_` prefix indicates this is age stratified by same age stratification as HIV adult population, this might be single
  year from
  15+ or could be coarse age groups
* `hc_` prefix indicates this is age stratified by the HIV child population
* `hc1_` prefix indicates this is age stratified by child population age 0 - 4
* `hc2_` prefix indicates this is age stratified by the child population age 5 - 14
* `idx_` prefix means this is an index, e.g. `idx_hm_elig` is the index of the CD4 count at which people are eligible
  for ART. Note this is not used for prefixing the loop variables
* Uppercase means this is a dimension of the state space e.g. `NS` or `pAG`
* `ts_` prefix means this is a time step
* `hts_` prefix means this is an HIV time step (i.e. a time step of the inner HIV loop)

These prefixes can be merged e.g.

* `p_idx_hiv_first_adult` - Is the index of the first age group within singe-year ages to be considered an adult

## State space

In `StateSpace` struct

| Leapfrog | Frogger  | Details                                                        |
